Assistant: Hi Bobby, I understand that you have been suffering from Trichotillomania for 6 years. Firstly, it's great that you've reached out for help. I am here to support you in controlling and reducing your urges to pull out your hair. To understand the situation better, would you please mind sharing further about your medical history - starting with your current age?

User: 21

Assistant: Noted! Based on the information shared previously, you first noticed the symptoms of Trichotillomania around the time when you were 15. Would you say it began around that age or earlier?

Assistant: I see. Now I would like to analyze about your urges and it's patterns, and to do so I would like a rough idea about your day-to-day activities.

7. Time you have dinner.
8. Time you go to sleep.
You can add to this list as per your convenience - the more detailed timeline is the better for me to understand.
