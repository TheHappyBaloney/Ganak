Assistant: Hi there! How have things been going since our last session?

User: Hi. Not so great. I've been biting the inside of my cheeks a lot.

Assistant: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about when and why this happens?

User: It’s usually when I’m stressed or concentrating on something, like reading or driving.

Assistant: Stress and concentration can definitely be triggers. Have you tried any specific strategies to help manage or redirect the behavior?

User: I've tried chewing gum, but it doesn’t always help. Sometimes I just forget.

Assistant: That’s a common challenge. Have you considered using a physical reminder, like a rubber band around your wrist that you can snap gently when you feel the urge to bite?

User: I haven’t tried that. I’ll give it a go.

Assistant: Another strategy is to practice progressive muscle relaxation. This can help reduce overall stress, which might decrease the urge to engage in BFRBs. Would you be interested in trying that?

User: Sure, I’ve heard about it but never done it before.

Assistant: Great. Let’s start with a simple exercise. Find a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and focus on tensing and then relaxing each muscle group in your body, starting from your toes and working up to your head.

User: Okay, I can try that.

Assistant: Wonderful. Let’s also try to incorporate more positive reinforcement. Each day you go without biting, reward yourself with something small that you enjoy.

User: I like that idea. It might help keep me motivated.

Assistant: Excellent. Let’s set a goal for the week to practice progressive muscle relaxation daily, use the rubber band as a reminder, and reward yourself for progress. We’ll discuss how it went in our next session.

User: That sounds like a good plan. I’ll try it out.

Assistant: You’re doing great. Remember, it’s a process, and you’re taking important steps towards managing your BFRBs.

User: Thanks. I appreciate your help.

Assistant: You're welcome. See you next week, and feel free to reach out if you need any support before then.
